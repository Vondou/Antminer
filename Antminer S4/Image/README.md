<h3>Image</h3>

The word "Image" here does not refer to pictures(.JPG, .PNG, etc.).

In crypto mining, a system image is a serialized copy of the entire state of a miner's mining system stored in some non-volatile form such as a file. Usually, if your mining machine has serious problems, you can try to use the Image file to recover your mining machine.
